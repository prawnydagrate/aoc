# Advent of Code 2024: Day 5

**Part 1**: Well, part 1 looks easy. I've decided to do it in Rust so I can take advantage of iterators. Part 1 is so suspiciously easy, especially for day 5, that I've already started thinking up potential plot twists in part 2. Therefore I'm not gonna solve part 1 the 'first thing that came to mind' way, but rather I'm gonna solve it so that it works even if they say something like, for example, every 3 lines should be considered as one.

# Advent of Code: Day 7

**Part 1**: I was outside the whole day without access to my laptop, so it's 10:13 PM rn and I'm about to start part 1. I did look at the problem in my free time, and I realized that brute force is more than viable for this part, but I decided to write a recursive algorithm that does just a teeny tiny bit of pruning. I even wrote the code on my phone, which I'm gonna copy over.
